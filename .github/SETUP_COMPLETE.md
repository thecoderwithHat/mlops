   - Smoke testing

### Documentation Files
1. **.github/workflows/README.md** - Comprehensive workflow documentation
2. **.github/CICD_QUICKREF.md** - Quick reference guide
3. **tests/test_prediction_service.py** - Sample test file
4. **tests/requirements.txt** - Test dependencies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Configure GitHub Repository

#### Add Secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
```bash
# Optional secrets (add as needed)
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://your-mlflow-server:5000
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

#### Set Up Environments:
- **staging**: For testing deployments
- **production**: Requires approval before deployment

#### Enable Branch Protection:
- Go to Settings → Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch
- Require status checks: `lint`, `test (3.11)`

### 2. Test the CI/CD Pipeline

#### Push to trigger main pipeline:
```bash
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add CI/CD workflows"
git push origin main
```

#### Run model training manually:
```bash
gh workflow run train-model.yml \
  -f model_type=xgboost \
  -f data_month=2021-01 \
  -f experiment_name=duration-prediction
```

#### Deploy to staging:
```bash
gh workflow run deploy-service.yml \
  -f environment=staging \
  -f model_version=v1.0.0 \
  -f service_type=web-service
```

### 3. Monitor Workflows

View workflow runs:
```bash
# List recent runs
gh run list --limit 10

# Watch running workflow
gh run watch

# Download artifacts
gh run download RUN_ID
```

- **Main Documentation**: [.github/workflows/README.md](.github/workflows/README.md)
- **Quick Reference**: [.github/CICD_QUICKREF.md](.github/CICD_QUICKREF.md)
- **Monitoring Setup**: [05-monitoring/README.md](../05-monitoring/README.md)

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Workflows
Edit files in `.github/workflows/` to customize:
- Trigger conditions
- Job configurations
- Deployment strategies
- Testing requirements

### Add New Jobs
```yaml
new-job:
  name: My New Job
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Run my task
      run: echo "Hello World"
```

### Change Deployment Target
Update `deploy-service.yml` with your infrastructure:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to AWS
  run: |
    aws ecs update-service \
      --cluster my-cluster \
      --service my-service \
      --force-new-deployment
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If workflows fail:
1. Check workflow logs in Actions tab
2. Enable debug logging (see CICD_QUICKREF.md)
3. Test locally using `act` tool
4. Review common issues in workflows README
